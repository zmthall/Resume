    <h1>Zachary Thallas' Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Watching Movies</h2>
<p>One of my favorite things to do when I have time to do it is sit down and enjoy movies I've already seen or movies I haven't already seen.</p>
<hr />
<h3>My favorite movie genres:</h3>

    <li>Suspense/Thriller/Psychological Thriller</li>
    <li>Action</li>
    <li>Comedy</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning New Things</h2>
<p>I can't say this sounds like a hobby but one of my favorite things to do in my spare time is try to learn something that I didn't know before.

<h2>Exploring Places</h2>
<p>The only way to truly enjoy an area that you live in is to explore it when you have free time. I've seen so many great places by just hopping in the car and following roads with unknown destinations. I learned that the more you put the GPS away the better you know where you are traveling.</p>
